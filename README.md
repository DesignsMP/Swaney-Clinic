# Website Project
This is a website I am creating for a Veterinary Clinic in Kingman, Ks. The purpose of the site is to give customers a place to find answeres to their questions when the facility is unavailable. This includes office hours, the location, and the services they provide along with an estimated cost associated with them. There is also a section on the sight that talks about the clinics involvement with the Kingman County Humane Society along with a link to their site.
